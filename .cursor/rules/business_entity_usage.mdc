# Business Entity Usage

## Core Principle
- All business entities MUST be defined in the `echo/sdk` package
- NEVER create business entities directly in symphony project

## Implementation Guidelines
- Always import entity definitions from the appropriate `echo/sdk` package
- Use the SDK entity contracts for all business logic implementations
- ALWAYS ask for the exact entity name from the SDK before implementing
- If you're unsure about which entity to use, ask for clarification

## When Entity Is Missing
- If a required entity is not available in the SDK:
  1. Document the missing entity and its required fields
  2. DO NOT create temporary entities or implementations in the hubs project
  3. Add clear TODO comments indicating the pending SDK dependency
  4. Consult with the team to determine the appropriate approach
  5. The only alternative is to use existing SDK entities unless explicitly specified in the context of the request

## Entity Extension
- DO NOT propose extending entities
- The only alternative is to use existing SDK entities as they are
- If the context of the request explicitly specifies extending entities, confirm this approach before proceeding
